19. Which bus has appeared closest to your favorite location?
Obtain the coordinates of your favorite location (e.g. workplace, home, restaurant, bar, club, cinema, cafÃ©, gym) using e.g. GPS or an online map.
For a small area, such as Athens, you can use the simple Euclidean distance formula for calculating the distance between your workplace and the bus's location. (4 points)
If you cannot obtain an answer for this question based on distance, choose a bus at random, using e.g. the shuf command. (1 point)
The answer to this question will become the "chosen bus" specified in the next questions.
